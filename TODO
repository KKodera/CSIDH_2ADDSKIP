currently 2296 mults for l=587 bs=16 gs=9:
* 180 = 6*30 for initial 30 multiples of kernel point
* 117 for poly_tree1 (product tree for linear polys)
* 171 = 19*gs for biquadratics
* 236 = 2*118 for 2 multiprod2 (product of quadratics) for pushing point
* 148 = 2*74 for 2 multiprod2_selfreciprocal for pushing curve
* 170 for multieval_precompute (reciprocal of root of product tree)
  * try faster reciprocals; see generally https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.1926
* 1140 = 4*285 for 4 multieval_postcompute (scaled remainder tree) 
  * automatically decide between scaled and unscaled
* 60 = 4*(bs-1) for accumulating multieval results
* 30 = 6*5 for 5=(587-1)/2-2*bs*gs stray points at the end
* 32 for lth powers
* 12 for final squarings, 8th powers, mults into Q and A

saving mults inside poly arithmetic:
* try montgomery's karatsuba-like formulas
* try (more) adk
* try toom
* unify handling of products and middle products
* try mulders for low/high products
* adapt all product techniques to self-reciprocal products

more sophisticated cost metrics than simply counting mults in ring code:
* merge reductions in, e.g., ab+cd (should be a big win)
* use lazy reductions more broadly
* use safegcd inversions (should also speed up old code somewhat)
